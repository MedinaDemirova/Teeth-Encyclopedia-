<h3 class="headermain" >Teeth Conditions</h3><br>

<ul>
<li>Cavities (caries): Bacteria evade removal by brushing and saliva and damage the enamel and deeper structures of teeth. Most cavities occur on molars and premolars.</li>
<li>Tooth decay: A general name for disease of the teeth, including cavities.</li>
<li>Periodontitis: Inflammation of the deeper structures of the teeth (periodontal ligament, jawbone, and cementum). Poor oral hygiene is usually to blame.</li>
<li>Gingivitis: Inflammation of the surface portion of the gums, around and between the crowns of the teeth. Plaque and tartar buildup can lead to gingivitis.</li>
<li>Plaque: A sticky, colorless film made of bacteria and the substances they secrete. Plaque develops quickly on teeth after eating sugary food, but can be easily brushed off.</li>
<li>Tartar: If plaque is not removed, it mixes with minerals to become tartar, a harder substance. Tartar requires professional cleaning for removal.</li>
<li>Overbite: The upper teeth protrude significantly over the lower teeth.</li>
<li>Underbite: The lower teeth protrude significantly past the upper teeth.</li>
<li>Teeth grinding (bruxism): Stress, anxiety, or sleep disorders can cause teeth grinding, usually during sleep. A dull headache or sore jaw can be symptoms.</li>
<li>Tooth sensitivity: When one or more teeth become sensitive to hot or cold, it may mean the dentin is exposed.</li>
